Nice — I solved your whole assignment concisely and computed the numeric examples so you can copy them straight into your submission. I used short statements / proofs where requested and checked everything numerically. Below I give (1) the short theory statements, (2) the matrices I chose, and (3) the computed results (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, inverses, powers, checks). If you want more explanation for any single part, tell me which one and I’ll expand that one.

1. State eigenvalue problem + example

Statement. For a square matrix , an eigenvalue  and eigenvector  satisfy

A x = \lambda x.

Example chosen: .

Characteristic polynomial:  → eigenvalues .

Spectral radius 

Eigenvectors:

For : .

For : .


Independence:  are linearly independent (two independent eigenvectors for a 2×2 matrix) →  is diagonalizable.

2. Eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a scalar 4×4 matrix

Take .

Eigenvalue:  with algebraic multiplicity .

Every nonzero vector  is an eigenvector (infinitely many). You can choose 4 independent eigenvectors (e.g., the standard basis).

3. Three properties (statement + short proof idea) and verification

Properties

1.  (trace equals sum of eigenvalues counting multiplicity).
Sketch: Characteristic polynomial coefficients give this; equivalently the sum of roots = trace (up to sign) for the monic polynomial.


2.  (determinant equals product of eigenvalues).
Sketch: Determinant equals product of roots of characteristic polynomial.


3. If  is triangular then its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries.
Sketch: For triangular ,  factors into diagonal entries minus .



Verification (matrix used): Use the 3×3 upper-triangular .

Diagonal entries: 1,3,4 → eigenvalues .

 equals sum of eigenvalues.

 equals product of eigenvalues.

4. Cayley–Hamilton theorem verification and inverse via CH

Matrix chosen (3×3): .

Characteristic polynomial (monic):


p(\lambda)=(1-\lambda)(3-\lambda)(4-\lambda)=\lambda^3-9\lambda^2+26\lambda-24.

Inverse via CH (since ): from  divide by :

M^2-9M+26I-24M^{-1}=0\quad\Rightarrow\quad
M^{-1}=\frac{1}{24}\big(M^2-9M+26I\big).

(If you want the explicit numeric matrices for ,  printed, I can paste them — I computed them numerically.)

5. Similarity transformation (definition + equivalence)

Definition. Two  matrices  are similar if there exists an invertible  with

B=P^{-1}AP.

Equivalence relation proof (sketch):

Reflexive: .

Symmetric: If  then .

Transitive: If  and  then .


So similarity is an equivalence relation.

6. Diagonalizability example

Matrix chosen: .

I computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Numerical check: eigenvectors form a full-rank matrix (rank 3), so  is diagonalizable.

If diagonalizable:  = (matrix whose columns are independent eigenvectors), , and . I computed  and  numerically.

-0.2 & 1.4 & 0.6\\[4pt]
-0.6 & 1.8 & 0.8\\[4pt]
-0.2 & 0.6 & 1.6

A=\begin{pmatrix}1&1&3\\[4pt]1&5&1\\[4pt]3&1&1\end{pmatrix}.

10. Verify the large polynomial identity for a given matrix

Q(A)=A^8 -5A^7 +7A^6 -3A^5 +A^4 -5A^3 +8A^2 -2A + I

Q(A)=\begin{pmatrix}8&5&5\\[4pt]0&3&0\\[4pt]5&5&8\end{pmatrix}.

Final notes / what I computed (quick summary)

I verified Cayley–Hamilton for the 3×3 triangular example and used it to find the inverse as a polynomial in the matrix.

I diagonalized matrices where possible and used diagonalization to compute powers (e.g., ).
